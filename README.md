# Computer Vision With Scarce Labels


This hobby-project consists of a dataset that contains an unlabelled set of images and a smaller dataset that contains labeled images. Those images represent shirts from e-commerce, so usually, the background is plain and the product is the focus of the image. The unlabelled dataset provided contains 5K samples and the labeled one contains just 10 images, all blue shirts. The goal is to analyze the datasets and build a model that is able to retrieve all the blue shirts from the 5K dataset.
